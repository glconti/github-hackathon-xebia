This project contains a React + TypeScript frontend (in /frontend) and a .NET 9 Web API backend (in /backend) for a multiplayer Battleship game. The backend provides REST endpoints for game logic and multiplayer support. The frontend communicates with the backend API.

- Use modern React best practices for the frontend.
- Use .NET 9 Web API conventions and best practices for the backend.
- Keep the code modular and easy to extend for additional features like authentication or real-time play.
