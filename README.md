# Battleship Multiplayer Web Application

This project is a simple multiplayer Battleship game with:
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript (Vite) in `/frontend`
- **Backend**: .NET 9 Web API in `/backend`

## Getting Started

### Frontend
1. `cd frontend`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`

### Backend
1. `cd backend`
2. `dotnet run`

## Project Structure
- `/frontend`: React app for the game UI
- `/backend`: .NET 9 Web API for game logic and multiplayer endpoints

## Next Steps
- Implement REST endpoints for game creation, joining, and moves in the backend
- Build the Battleship game UI and connect to the backend API
